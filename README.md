# LocalSathi

## Idea
LocalSathi is a website designed to assist both tourists and local people. 

### Tourist View
In today's world, tourists often encounter incidents and overpricing by guides. LocalSathi aims to address this issue by providing a platform where tourists can connect with local guides at reasonable prices, ensuring transparency and authentic experiences.

### Local People View
Many young students and unemployed individuals possess extensive knowledge about their areas but struggle to find opportunities to earn money. LocalSathi provides them with a platform to offer their expertise as guides, showcasing hidden gems and providing valuable insights to tourists.

### Combined Solution
